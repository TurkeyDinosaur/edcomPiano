    <h2>Introduction to the Piano</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this site, you will learn the building blocks of piano. With these basics you should be able to continue your learning independently to whatever level you wish. If you do not have access to a piano or keyboard, you can go to a website that has an online piano that you can complete some of the basics with, one of which is linked below, however it may be hard to progress to a high level.<br><br>
      <a href="https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano">Play an Online Piano!</a><br><br>
      Along the left side of each page, you will see the Navigation bar, where you can see all the lessons currently on the site.<br><br>
      To get you in the piano playing mood, the video below is one of my favourite performances by the revered Oscar Peterson.<br><br><br>
