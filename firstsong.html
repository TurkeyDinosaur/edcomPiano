    <h2>Learn your first song</h2>
    <p>
      There are lots of ways to learn to play a song, so you need to find the best way for you. For some people who can read sheet music very well, it is the fastest way to learn, however for others, a video tutorial is the best way. <br>
      As I find a video tutorial the easiest, below will be one for you to attempt to follow, I generally find it is best to constantly pause the tutorial and practice parts of the songs, then play it and continue.<br><br>
      This is a great video that is very well paced to teach a very simple pop song by Lewis Capaldi, It doesnt really matter at this stage how you feel about the song as it is just good practice, however feel free to find a different song to learn if you happen to have some sort of vendetta against this particular Scotsman.<br><br>
      There is sheet music at the bottom of the video so you can get comfortable with how that looks, but it isnt necessary to learn the song.

    <p>From this stage, piano becomes a test of your persistence and patience, with amazing rewards for your efforts, so I hope you enjoy playing as much as I do!</p>
