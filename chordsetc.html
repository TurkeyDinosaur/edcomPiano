    <h2>Learning Chords and Hand Positioning</h2>
    <p>A chord are a set of notes that are in a particular scale, A scale is a way of playing the 8 different notes in a certain way to produce a type of sound. There are lots of different types of scales, such as major scales, minor scales and blues scales.<br><br>
      A chord is multiple notes that are played at the same time to make a new sound. If you have a piano available, you can play the three notes, C, E and G at the same time. This is the C major chord (All 3 of these notes are in the C major scale). If you now play the same notes, but instead of E, you play Eâ™­, you will play the C minor chord.<br><br>
      These chords use the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes in their scale. Below is a video that shows the two chords, note the difference in the feeling they produce.

    <p><br>As music is often comprised of different chords, it is important to play them in a comfortable way for your hands. While there are no set rules for how to do this, a good rule of thumb for your right hand, is to have your thumb on the lowest note you are playing and your following fingers comfortably spread over the other notes.<br> For example, the C major chord that I mentioned earlier is generally played with the thumb, the middle finger and the fifth finger.
    <br><br><b>Task At Home (If you have a piano)</b> <br><br>Pick a chord and practice playing it, taking your hand off the piano and resetting its position, then play it again. Eventually you will be able to do this with no difficulty. Then you can choose a different chord and practice moving between them as seamlessly as possible. Do this with both your left and right hand independently.<br> (If you cannot work out any other chords, you can pick a note and search it on google to find the "triad", a chord with the 1st, 3rd and 5th note).</p>
