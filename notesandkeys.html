    <h2>Learning notes and the keys</h2>
    <p>
      On a piano, each 'button' is called a key, each key corresponds to a note. There are eight notes on a piano which are represented by the white keys. Each eight notes are called octaves. An octave on the left of the piano is the same note, but at a lower register.
<br><br> The black keys are called sharps and flats. If it is to the right of a note, it is called a sharp, written as #, if it is to the left, a flat, written as ♭. This means that a C# is also a D♭ <br>
<br> Here is an image that shows which keys are which notes. The most important one is the note C, which is just to the left of the 2 black notes.    </p>
